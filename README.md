# rd_parsers
This repositary has a set of recursive descent parsers. I coded these to get some hands-on experience in recursive descent parsers.
The lexer is obtained from Eli Bendersky blog [1].
The initial grammer is ubiquitous expression grammer seen in the dragon book and elsewhere. It has left associtivity problems which is fixed using EBNF.
